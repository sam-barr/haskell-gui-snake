# haskell-gui-snake

This is the snake game written in haskell with a graphical interface.
Implemented with gloss.

# Requirements
If on arch linux or something which uses pacman this should do it:
`pacman -S opengl glu`
If that doesn't work, don't @ me

# Building
Should be as simple as running `stack build`.

# Running

Should be as simple as `stack exec snake`
