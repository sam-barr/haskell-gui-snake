# haskell-gui-snake

This is the snake game written in haskell with a graphical interface.
Implemented with gloss.

# Requirements
`gloss` requires GLUT and OpenGL. I don't remember if stack can install these things for you.

# Building
Should be as simple as running `stack build`.

# Running

Should be as simple as `stack exec snake`
